## Additional Resources & Tips
	•	Python Reference: Keep the official Python docs handy for built-in data structures & methods.
	•	Math Supplements: Have a cheat sheet for logarithm properties, exponents, big-O notation quick reference.
	•	Consistency: Even 1 hour a day yields great progress if you stick with it.
	•	Practice Out Loud: For interviews, always verbalize your thought process.

## Next Steps
	1.	Set up a version control repository (GitHub/Bitbucket) to store all exercises and projects.
	2.	Choose your coding environment (Jupyter notebooks, local IDE, or an online coding platform).
	3.	Plan how you’ll get feedback and validation (e.g., test scripts, a friend/mentor for code reviews, or online judge systems).

With this structure, you’ll gain both a deep understanding of fundamental data structures and algorithms and the confidence to tackle real coding interviews. Plus, by building mini-projects, you’ll accumulate tangible portfolio items to show your skills.
